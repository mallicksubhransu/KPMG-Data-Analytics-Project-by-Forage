## Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Assess and ensure the quality and completeness of the data.
- Generate insights to identify high-value customers based on demographics and attributes.
- Create a dashboard for the client to help target specific customer segments and the broader market.

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment

### Step 1: Assess Data Quality
- **Data Completeness**:
  - Check for missing values in the dataset.
  - Identify incomplete records and fields with a high percentage of missing data.

- **Data Consistency**:
  - Ensure consistency in data formats (e.g., dates, categorical values).
  - Check for duplicate entries and inconsistencies.

- **Data Accuracy**:
  - Verify the accuracy of the data against known standards or through sample checks.
  - Identify any outliers or anomalies that may indicate errors.

### Step 2: Mitigate Data Quality Issues
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handle missing values through imputation or removal of affected records.
  - Standardize data formats and correct inconsistencies.

- **Draft Email to Client**:
  - Prepare an email to the client summarizing the identified data quality issues.
  - Suggest strategies to mitigate these issues, such as data cleaning techniques, data validation rules, and recommendations for improving data collection processes.

### Step 3: Documentation
- Document the data quality assessment process and the actions taken to address any issues.
- Save the data quality report and the drafted client email in the `docs` directory of the repository.

## Task 2: Data Insights

### Step 1: Analyze Customer Demographics
- **Segment Customers**:
  - Analyze customer demographics such as age, gender, income, location, etc.

### Step 2: Design Dashboard
- **Tools and Technologies**:
  - Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or a Python-based dashboard (e.g., Dash, Streamlit) to create the dashboard.
  - Design intuitive and interactive visualizations to present the data insights.

### Step 3: Implement Dashboard
- **Data Integration**:
  - Integrate the cleaned and analyzed data into the dashboard.
  - Ensure the dashboard is dynamic and updates with new data.

- **User Interface**:
  - Create a user-friendly interface with filters, drill-down options, and clear navigation.

### Step 4: Dashboard Deployment
- **Deployment Options**:
  - Deploy the dashboard on a web server or share it via a cloud platform.
  - Provide the client with access instructions and usage documentation.

### Step 5: Documentation
- Document the dashboard creation process and provide user instructions.
- Save the dashboard files and the user guide in the `dashboard` directory of the repository.
